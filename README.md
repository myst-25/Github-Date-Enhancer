# GitHub Date Enhancer

Shows exact creation and commit dates alongside relative times on GitHub.

## Features
- Displays the full, absolute date (e.g., "Apr 27, 2024") next to relative times (e.g., "3 days ago") on issues, pull requests, commits, and more.
- Works automatically on all GitHub pages.
- No configuration required.
- All processing is done locallyâ€”no data is sent anywhere.

## How it works
The extension scans GitHub pages for relative time elements and adds the corresponding absolute date next to them. It updates automatically as you navigate or as new content loads.
